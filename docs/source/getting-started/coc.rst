CASA Code of Conduct
========================================

The CASA Group is committed to advancing climate and atmospheric science research while developing the next generation of computational scientists. This code of conduct outlines our shared values and behavioral expectations for all group members—graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, staff, visiting scientists, and collaborators. This is a living document that reflects our collective commitment to creating an inclusive, respectful, and professional environment where all members can thrive.

Our Mission and Core Values
------------------------------------

The CASA Group pursues two primary objectives:

1. Advancing fundamental research in climate and atmospheric science through rigorous computational modeling
2. Developing the next generation of scientists through mentorship, professional development, and collaborative learning

We recognize that good science requires diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. We are committed to creating a lab culture where all members feel valued, respected, and supported.

Inclusivity and Respect
------------------------------------

We are dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment where differences are celebrated rather than tolerated:

- All members deserve equal respect regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability, religion, or socioeconomic background
- We actively work to integrate diverse voices in our science and decision-making processes
- Senior members use their privilege to amplify and support voices from underrepresented groups
- We commit to dedicating time and resources to discussions about equity, diversity, and anti-racism in atmospheric science
- Language that is discriminatory, exclusionary, homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, sexist, or otherwise demeaning will not be tolerated

Professional Conduct and Communication
------------------------------------

We maintain high standards of professionalism and mutual respect:

- Treat all colleagues with courtesy and kindness, in person and online
- Use correct names and pronouns for all members
- Communicate respectfully and avoid condescending language
- Assume good faith in interactions; most miscommunications are unintentional
- Email and text-based communication can be easily misinterpreted—when in doubt, seek clarification through direct conversation or a meeting
- Listen actively without interruption during meetings and discussions
- Be punctual, organized, and responsive in your professional obligations
- Accept responsibility for mistakes, learn from them, and support others in doing the same

Collaboration and Shared Responsibility
------------------------------------

Science advances through collaboration. We foster a culture of teamwork where:

- All members contribute meaningfully to research discussions and activities
- We actively help colleagues troubleshoot problems, share expertise, and improve methods
- Feedback is constructive, thoughtful, and aimed at strengthening science
- All contributions—published, unpublished, technical support, ideas, and informal assistance—are acknowledged and valued
- Senior members mentor junior colleagues and facilitate networking opportunities
- We partner across departments, institutions, and international collaborators to advance atmospheric science
- We challenge ideas rigorously while treating people with respect—we debate science, not personalities

Mentorship and Professional Development
------------------------------------

We are committed to supporting the professional growth of all members:

**For Mentors:**
- Establish regular, structured meetings with mentees
- Help clarify career goals and development paths
- Facilitate networking and professional connections
- Provide constructive feedback and recognition for contributions
- Be accessible and responsive to concerns
- Support work-life balance and personal wellbeing

**For Mentees:**
- Communicate concerns and needs promptly with mentors
- Engage actively in your professional development
- Seek to understand project context and broader research goals
- Take initiative in learning and seeking feedback

**For All Members:**
- Approach learning with openness and humility, recognizing we all have expertise gaps
- Share knowledge generously with colleagues at all levels
- Celebrate colleagues' achievements and contributions

Safe and Respectful Workspaces
------------------------------------

We maintain shared spaces where all members feel comfortable working:

- Everyone is entitled to clean, distraction-free work areas
- Keep shared spaces organized and clean before departing
- Respect colleagues' focus time and minimize unnecessary interruptions
- Use computing resources responsibly and mindfully
- Respect physical and personal boundaries
- Do not share others' personal information, health status, or circumstances without explicit consent

Harassment and Discrimination
------------------------------------

We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination of any kind:

- Harassment includes unwelcome conduct, comments, or behavior based on any characteristic listed above
- Sexual language, imagery, or advances are prohibited
- Discrimination based on ability, disability, appearance, or any other characteristic is not tolerated
- Retaliation against anyone reporting concerns is prohibited
- Every member has the responsibility to contribute to a harassment-free environment

If you experience or witness harassment or discrimination, you have several options:

**Reporting Options:**
- Speak directly with the involved person if you feel safe doing so
- Contact group leadership confidentially
- Submit a formal complaint through your institution
- Contact your institution's HR department, Title IX office, or ombudsperson
- Use your institution's anonymous reporting hotline

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Minor misunderstandings should first be addressed directly with involved parties in a professional manner
- If direct conversation doesn't resolve the issue, escalate to group leadership for mediation
- For serious matters, formal institutional channels are available

Anti-Racism and Social Awareness
------------------------------------

We recognize that atmospheric science does not operate in a vacuum. Systemic inequities have historically excluded many voices from our field, and these disparities persist:

- We are committed to actively discussing and addressing systemic racism and oppression in academia and science
- We work to implement anti-racist practices in our recruitment, mentorship, and lab culture
- We actively engage in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives
- We acknowledge and learn from historical injustices in our field
- We use our platform and resources to support colleagues from underrepresented groups

Practical Principles for Lab Life
------------------------------------

**Communication Norms:**
- Respond to messages and emails promptly (within 1-2 business days when possible)
- Be clear about expectations regarding work hours and availability
- Discuss concerns directly rather than through third parties when possible

**Meetings and Discussions:**
- All perspectives deserve to be heard; use a "take space, make space" approach
- Challenge ideas and conclusions, not the people presenting them
- Acknowledge valid points even when you disagree on the overall assessment

**Recognition and Acknowledgement:**
- Celebrate both individual and collective achievements
- Give credit appropriately in publications, presentations, and conversations
- Recognize informal contributions and peer support

Creating the Culture We Want
------------------------------------

This code of conduct is only as strong as our collective commitment to upholding it. Every member of CASA has a responsibility to:

- Model the behavior we expect
- Support colleagues who may be struggling or facing barriers
- Speak up respectfully when you see problems or concerning behavior
- Continuously reflect on and improve our practices
- Contribute your authentic self to our community

Remember that harm is sometimes unintentional. When someone points out that your behavior was hurtful, respond with curiosity and a willingness to understand, rather than defensiveness.

Questions and Concerns
------------------------------------

If you have questions about this code of conduct, concerns about group dynamics, or need support, please reach out to group leadership. We are committed to addressing issues promptly and fairly, and to maintaining confidentiality when appropriate.

We look forward to working with you and building a lab community where all members can do their best work.
